Contactbook is a simple alternative to the Google contacts app which
 won't share any information to others. It does use its own database, so
 everything is saved locally: nothing goes to any cloud, and other apps won't
 have access. 
Also for privacy reasons it just uses a minimal set of
 permissions: CALL_PHONE (so you can call your contacts), and CAMERA (to add
 contact photos and import contacts via QR codes).

 
The app was made by Anatoli Sch√§fer and Marc Zintel and the project was
 given by Prof. Dr. Manh Tien Tran. The project was a part of the Master
 degrees of computer science at the Hochschule Kaiserslautern.
